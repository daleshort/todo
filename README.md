# To-Do
Simple React and Django to-do tracking application. A live deployement is [available here.](https://programmerd.com/)

I started with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSYAjTG46EI) plus filling in the steps in the video skipped about adding the form actions.  I then changed the database engine to MySQL.  I figured out how to deploy the app to a Digital Ocean Droplet using Gunicorn and Nginx.  The live demo site supports Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment via a git hook script on the remote server that automatically builds and deploys the project when I push an update from development.
